/- Hint : Propositional Extensionality 

`constant propext {a b : Prop} : (a ↔ b) → a = b`


If two propositions imply one another, then those two propositions are equal. Here `constant` indicates that this is not just a theorem but an axiom.

Curly braces indicate that the arguments of `propext` may be left implicit and inferred from context.

/- Hint : Function Extensionality

`theorem funext {f₁ f₂ : Π x : α, β x} (h : ∀ x, f₁ x = f₂ x) : f₁ = f₂.`

If two functions agree on all arguments, then those functions are equal.

/- Hint : Set Extensionality

`theorem ext_iff {s t : set α} : s = t ↔ ∀ x, x ∈ s ↔ x ∈ t`


Two sets are equal if and only if they contain the same elements.
