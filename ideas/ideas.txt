Continuous implies preimage of open is open, is quite nice.

Imperial 2020 1st year analysis mid-term:

Let f:R->R be continuous and lim_{x->-inf}=0 and lim_{x->+inf}=1. Prove that for all 0<c<1 there exists x such that f(x)=c

Let S be a set such that every continuous function f:S->R is bounded. Prove S is closed.
